# Portfolio
This repository contains my **personal portfolio website**, created to showcase my skills, projects, and contact information.  
The portfolio is designed using **HTML and CSS** with a clean, responsive layout.
The portfolio website includes:
- A **Home page** with a brief introduction
- An **About Me** section highlighting my background and interests
- A **Projects** section showcasing my academic and personal projects
- A **Skills** section showcasing my technical and professional skills
- A **Contact** section with contact details

This project helps demonstrate my understanding of **web fundamentals** and **front-end design**.
